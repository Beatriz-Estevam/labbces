A few years ago we sequenced the genomes of some yeast strains used in [cachaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacha%C3%A7a) production, a Brazilian spirit. Today [our paper was published](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01759-23) in Applied and Environmental Microbiology a journal of the American Society for Microbiology.

Our study focuses on the isolation and selection of yeast strains for improving the quality of cachaca, a Brazilian spirit. The study analyzes the genomes of 11 different **Saccharomyces cerevisiae** strains to identify specific genetic variations common to cachaca yeast strains. We identified sequence variants present in these strains and their functional annotation revealed their involvement in flocculation, tolerance to fermentative stresses, production of volatile compounds, and ethanol production. The study suggests that these genetic markers and variants could be used as molecular markers for selecting yeast strains suitable for the fermentation process and for genetic improvement through genome editing. These findings contribute to understanding the genetic basis of traits relevant to industrial fermentation processes and can potentially lead to the production of high-quality beverages

This study was lead by [Prof. Rogelio Lopes Brand√£o](https://sites.ufop.br/lbcm/people/rog%C3%A9lio-lopes-brand%C3%A3o) from [Federal University of Ouro Preto](https://www.ufop.br/), and involved researchers from several institutions in Brazil.
