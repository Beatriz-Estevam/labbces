# Isabella Poletto participated at the "XXIV ENcontro de Genetica do Nordeste - ENGENE"

The XXIV ENGENE is a conference organized by the Brazilian Genetic Society, bringing together researchers in genetics and its intersections with biological, health, agricultural, and environmental sciences. The event was held in João Pessoa, PB, from November 12 to 15. Isabella Poletto contributed to the conference by presenting a portion of her master's dissertation results through a poster titled: "Caracterização molecular de genes endógenos no genoma da cana-de-açúcar por captura e sequenciamento de DNA de terceira geração" (Molecular Characterization of Endogenous Genes in the Sugarcane Genome through Capture and Sequencing of Third-Generation DNA).
