abstract: Invasive aspergillosis is predominantly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus,
  and adaptations to stresses experienced within the human host are a prerequisite
  for the survival and virulence strategies of the pathogen. The central signal transduction
  pathway operating during hyperosmotic stress is the high osmolarity glycerol mitogen-activated
  protein kinase cascade. A. fumigatus MpkC and SakA, orthologues of the Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae Hog1p, constitute the primary regulator of the hyperosmotic stress response.
  We compared A. fumigatus wild-type transcriptional response to osmotic stress with
  the ΔmpkC, ΔsakA, and ΔmpkC ΔsakA strains. Our results strongly indicate that MpkC
  and SakA have independent and collaborative functions during the transcriptional
  response to transient osmotic stress. We have identified and characterized null
  mutants for four A. fumigatus basic leucine zipper proteins transcription factors.
  The atfA and atfB have comparable expression levels with the wild-type in ΔmpkC
  but are repressed in ΔsakA and ΔmpkC ΔsakA post-osmotic stress. The atfC and atfD
  have reduced expression levels in all mutants post-osmotic stress. The atfA-D null
  mutants displayed several phenotypes related to osmotic, oxidative, and cell wall
  stresses. The ΔatfA and ΔatfB were shown to be avirulent and to have attenuated
  virulence, respectively, in both Galleria mellonella and a neutropenic murine model
  of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.
