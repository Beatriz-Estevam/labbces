abstract: The Plant Transcription Factor Database (PlnTFDB; http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/)
  is an integrative database that provides putatively complete sets of transcription
  factors (TFs) and other transcriptional regulators (TRs) in plant species (sensu
  lato) whose genomes have been completely sequenced and annotated. The complete sets
  of 84 families of TFs and TRs from 19 species ranging from unicellular red and green
  algae to angiosperms are included in PlnTFDB, representing >1.6 billion years of
  evolution of gene regulatory networks. For each gene family, a basic description
  is provided that is complemented by literature references, and multiple sequence
  alignments of protein domains. TF or TR gene entries include information of expressed
  sequence tags, 3D protein structures of homologous proteins, domain architecture
  and cross-links to other computational resources online. Moreover, the different
  species in PlnTFDB are linked to each other by means of orthologous genes facilitating
  cross-species comparisons.
