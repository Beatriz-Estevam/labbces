 abstract = {Biodiversity is proposed as a sustainable alternative for the economic development of high-biodiversity regions. Especially in the field of biodiversity genomics, the development of low-cost DNA sequencing opens an opportunity for new actors beyond academia to engage in genomic sequencing. However, it is challenging to adequately compensate non-academic actors such as local populations for their contribution to the innovation process, preventing better bioeconomy development. Although many repositories register genomic data to support biodiversity research, they do not facilitate the fair sharing of economic benefits. In this work, we propose the creation of the Amazon Biobank, a community-based genetic database. We employed blockchain to build a transparent and verifiable log of transactions involving genomic data, and we used smart contracts to implement an internal monetary system for all participants who collect, insert, process, store, and validate genomic data. We also used peer-to-peer solutions to allow users with commodity computers to collaborate with the storage and distribution of DNA files. By combining emerging technologies, Amazon Biobank provides adequate benefit-sharing among all participants that collaborate with data, knowledge, and computational resources. It also provides traceability and auditability, allowing easy association between biotechnological research and DNA data. In addition, the solution is highly scalable and less dependent on the trust deposited in any system player. Therefore, Amazon Biobank can become an important stepping stone to unlock the potential of bioeconomy in rich ecosystems such as the Amazon Rainforest.},
