abstract: Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) is an intermediate of trehalose biosynthesis
  that plays an essential role in plant metabolism and development. Here, we comprehensively
  analyzed sequences from enzymes of trehalose metabolism in sugarcane, one of the
  main crops used for bioenergy production. We identified protein domains, phylogeny,
  and in silico expression levels for all classes of enzymes. However, post-translational
  modifications and residues involved in catalysis and substrate binding were analyzed
  only in trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) sequences. We retrieved 71 putative
  full-length TPS, 93 trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP), and 3 trehalase (TRE)
  of sugarcane, showing all their conserved domains, respectively. Putative TPS (Classes
  I and II) and TPP sugarcane sequences were categorized into well-known groups reported
  in the literature. We measured the expression levels of the sequences from one sugarcane
  leaf transcriptomic dataset. Furthermore, TPS Class I has specific N-glycosylation
  sites inserted in conserved motifs and carries catalytic and binding residues in
  its TPS domain. Some of these residues are mutated in TPS Class II members, which
  implies loss of enzyme activity. Our approach retrieved many homo(eo)logous sequences
  for genes involved in trehalose metabolism, paving the way to discover the role
  of T6P signaling in sugarcane.
