 abstract = {Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) is an intermediate of trehalose biosynthesis that plays an essential role in plant metabolism and development. Here, we comprehensively analyzed sequences from enzymes of trehalose metabolism in sugarcane, one of the main crops used for bioenergy production. We identified protein domains, phylogeny, and in silico expression levels for all classes of enzymes. However, post-translational modifications and residues involved in catalysis and substrate binding were analyzed only in trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) sequences. We retrieved 71 putative full-length TPS, 93 trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP), and 3 trehalase (TRE) of sugarcane, showing all their conserved domains, respectively. Putative TPS (Classes I and II) and TPP sugarcane sequences were categorized into well-known groups reported in the literature. We measured the expression levels of the sequences from one sugarcane leaf transcriptomic dataset. Furthermore, TPS Class I has specific N-glycosylation sites inserted in conserved motifs and carries catalytic and binding residues in its TPS domain. Some of these residues are mutated in TPS Class II members, which implies loss of enzyme activity. Our approach retrieved many homo(eo)logous sequences for genes involved in trehalose metabolism, paving the way to discover the role of T6P signaling in sugarcane.},
