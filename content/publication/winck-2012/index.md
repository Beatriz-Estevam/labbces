abstract: Nuclear proteins play a central role in regulating gene expression. Their
  identification is important for understanding how the nuclear repertoire changes
  over time under different conditions. Nuclear proteins are often underrepresented
  in proteomic studies due to the frequently low abundance of proteins involved in
  regulatory processes. So far, only few studies describing the nuclear proteome of
  plant species have been published. Recently, the genome sequence of the unicellular
  green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been obtained and annotated, allowing the
  development of further detailed studies for this organism. However, a detailed description
  of its nuclear proteome has not been reported so far. Here, we present an analysis
  of the nuclear proteome of the sequenced Chlamydomonas strain cc503. Using LC-MS/MS,
  we identified 672 proteins from nuclei isolates with a maximum 1% peptide spectrum
  false discovery rate. Besides well-known proteins (e.g. histones), transcription
  factors and other transcriptional regulators (e.g. tubby and HMG) were identified.
  The presence of protein motifs in nuclear proteins was investigated by computational
  tools, and specific over-represented protein motifs were identified. This study
  provides new insights into the complexity of the nuclear environment and reveals
  novel putative protein targets for further studies of nuclear mechanisms.
