abstract: "BACKGROUND: Chloroplast genomes provide insufficient phylogenetic information\
  \ to distinguish between closely related sugarcane cultivars, due to the recent\
  \ origin of many cultivars and the conserved sequence of the chloroplast. In comparison,\
  \ the mitochondrial genome of plants is much larger and more plastic and could contain\
  \ increased phylogenetic signals. We assembled a consensus reference mitochondrion\
  \ with Illumina TruSeq synthetic long reads and Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION\
  \ long reads. Based on this assembly we also analyzed the mitochondrial transcriptomes\
  \ of sugarcane and sorghum and improved the annotation of the sugarcane mitochondrion\
  \ as compared with other species. METHODS: Mitochondrial genomes were assembled\
  \ from genomic read pools using a bait and assemble methodology. The mitogenome\
  \ was exhaustively annotated using BLAST and transcript datasets were mapped with\
  \ HISAT2 prior to analysis with the Integrated Genome Viewer. RESULTS: The sugarcane\
  \ mitochondrion is comprised of two independent chromosomes, for which there is\
  \ no evidence of recombination. Based on the reference assembly from the sugarcane\
  \ cultivar SP80-3280 the mitogenomes of four additional cultivars (R570, LCP85-384,\
  \ RB72343 and SP70-1143) were assembled (with the SP70-1143 assembly utilizing both\
  \ genomic and transcriptomic data). We demonstrate that the sugarcane plastome is\
  \ completely transcribed and we assembled the chloroplast genome of SP80-3280 using\
  \ transcriptomic data only. Phylogenomic analysis using mitogenomes allow closely\
  \ related sugarcane cultivars to be distinguished and supports the discrimination\
  \ between Saccharum officinarum and Saccharum cultum as modern sugarcane's female\
  \ parent. From whole chloroplast comparisons, we demonstrate that modern sugarcane\
  \ arose from a limited number of Saccharum cultum female founders. Transcriptomic\
  \ and spliceosomal analyses reveal that the two chromosomes of the sugarcane mitochondrion\
  \ are combined at the transcript level and that splice sites occur more frequently\
  \ within gene coding regions than without. We reveal one confirmed and one potential\
  \ cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) factor in the sugarcane mitochondrion, both of\
  \ which are transcribed. CONCLUSION: Transcript processing in the sugarcane mitochondrion\
  \ is highly complex with diverse splice events, the majority of which span the two\
  \ chromosomes. PolyA baited transcripts are consistent with the use of polyadenylation\
  \ for transcript degradation. For the first time we annotate two CMS factors within\
  \ the sugarcane mitochondrion and demonstrate that sugarcane possesses all the molecular\
  \ machinery required for CMS and rescue. A mechanism of cross-chromosomal splicing\
  \ based on guide RNAs is proposed. We also demonstrate that mitogenomes can be used\
  \ to perform phylogenomic studies on sugarcane cultivars."
