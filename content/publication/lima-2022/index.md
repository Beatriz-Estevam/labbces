abstract: Nitrate uptake in sugarcane roots is regulated at the transcriptional and
  posttranscriptional levels based on the physiological status of the plant and is
  likely a determinant mechanism for discrimination against nitrate. Sugarcane (Saccharum
  spp.) is one of the most suitable energy crops for biofuel feedstock, but the reduced
  recovery of nitrogen (N) fertilizer by sugarcane roots increases the crop carbon
  footprint. The low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of sugarcane has been associated
  with the significantly low nitrate uptake, which limits the utilization of the large
  amount of nitrate available in agricultural soils. To understand the regulation
  of nitrate uptake in sugarcane roots, we identified the major canonical nitrate
  transporter genes (NRTs-NITRATE TRANSPORTERS) and then determined their expression
  profiles in roots under contrasting N conditions. Correlation of gene expression
  with  N-nitrate uptake revealed that under N deprivation or inorganic N (ammonium
  or nitrate) supply in N-sufficient roots, the regulation of ScNRT2.1 and ScNRT3.1
  expression is the predominant mechanism for the modulation of the activity of the
  nitrate high-affinity transport system. Conversely, in N-deficient roots, the induction
  of ScNRT2.1 and ScNRT3.1 transcription is not correlated with the marked repression
  of nitrate uptake in response to nitrate resupply or high N provision, which suggested
  the existence of a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism. Our findings suggested
  that high-affinity nitrate uptake is regulated at the transcriptional and presumably
  at the posttranscriptional levels based on the physiological N status and that the
  regulation of NRT2.1 and NRT3.1 activity is likely a determinant mechanism for the
  discrimination against nitrate uptake observed in sugarcane roots, which contributes
  to the low NUE in this crop species.
