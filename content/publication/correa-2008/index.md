abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Transcription factors of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family
  control important processes in all eukaryotes. In plants, bZIPs are regulators of
  many central developmental and physiological processes including photomorphogenesis,
  leaf and seed formation, energy homeostasis, and abiotic and biotic stress responses.
  Here we performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of bZIP genes from algae,
  mosses, ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified
  13 groups of bZIP homologues in angiosperms, three more than known before, that
  represent 34 Possible Groups of Orthologues (PoGOs). The 34 PoGOs may correspond
  to the complete set of ancestral angiosperm bZIP genes that participated in the
  diversification of flowering plants. Homologous genes dedicated to seed-related
  processes and ABA-mediated stress responses originated in the common ancestor of
  seed plants, and three groups of homologues emerged in the angiosperm lineage, of
  which one group plays a role in optimizing the use of energy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
  Our data suggest that the ancestor of green plants possessed four bZIP genes functionally
  involved in oxidative stress and unfolded protein responses that are bZIP-mediated
  processes in all eukaryotes, but also in light-dependent regulations. The four founder
  genes amplified and diverged significantly, generating traits that benefited the
  colonization of new environments.'
