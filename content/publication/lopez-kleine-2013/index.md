abstract: The main objective of the present study was to reanalyse tomato expression
  data that was previously submitted to the Tomato Expression Database to dissect
  the resistance/defence genomic and metabolic responses of tomato to Phytophthora
  infestans under field conditions. Overrepresented gene sets belonging to chromosome
  10 were identified using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and we found that these
  genes tend to be located towards the end of the chromosome 10. An analysis of syntenic
  regions between Arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes and the tomato chromosome 10 allowed
  us to identify conserved regions in the two genomes. In addition to allowing for
  the identification of tomato candidate genes participating in resistance/defence
  in the field, this approach allowed us to investigate the relationships of the candidate
  genes with chromosomal position and participation in metabolic functions, thus offering
  more insight into the phenomena occurring during the infection process.
