abstract: Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) represent a huge resource for the discovery
  of previously unknown genetic information and functional genome assignment. In this
  study we screened a collection of 178 292 ESTs from Arabidopsis thaliana by testing
  them against previously annotated genes of the Arabidopsis genome. We identified
  several hundreds of new transcripts that match the Arabidopsis genome at so far
  unassigned loci. The transcriptional activity of these loci was independently confirmed
  by comparison with the Salk Whole Genome Array Data. To a large extent, the newly
  identified transcriptionally active genomic regions do not encode 'classic' proteins,
  but instead generate non-coding RNAs and/or small peptide-coding RNAs of presently
  unknown biological function. More than 560 transcripts identified in this study
  are not represented by the Affymetrix GeneChip arrays currently widely used for
  expression profiling in A. thaliana. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that
  numerous previously unknown genes exist in the Arabidopsis genome.
