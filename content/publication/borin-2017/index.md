abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Second generation (2G) ethanol is produced by breaking down
  lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars. In Brazil, sugarcane bagasse has
  been proposed as the lignocellulosic residue for this biofuel production. The enzymatic
  cocktails for the degradation of biomass-derived polysaccharides are mostly produced
  by fungi, such as Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei. However, it is not yet
  fully understood how these microorganisms degrade plant biomass. In order to identify
  transcriptomic changes during steam-exploded bagasse (SEB) breakdown, we conducted
  a RNA-seq comparative transcriptome profiling of both fungi growing on SEB as carbon
  source. RESULTS: Particular attention was focused on CAZymes, sugar transporters,
  transcription factors (TFs) and other proteins related to lignocellulose degradation.
  Although genes coding for the main enzymes involved in biomass deconstruction were
  expressed by both fungal strains since the beginning of the growth in SEB, significant
  differences were found in their expression profiles. The expression of these enzymes
  is mainly regulated at the transcription level, and A. niger and T. reesei also
  showed differences in TFs content and in their expression. Several sugar transporters
  that were induced in both fungal strains could be new players on biomass degradation
  besides their role in sugar uptake. Interestingly, our findings revealed that in
  both strains several genes that code for proteins of unknown function and pro-oxidant,
  antioxidant, and detoxification enzymes were induced during growth in SEB as carbon
  source, but their specific roles on lignocellulose degradation remain to be elucidated.
  CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a time-course experiment monitoring the
  degradation of pretreated bagasse by two important fungi using the RNA-seq technology.
  It was possible to identify a set of genes that might be applied in several biotechnology
  fields. The data suggest that these two microorganisms employ different strategies
  for biomass breakdown. This knowledge can be exploited for the rational design of
  enzymatic cocktails and 2G ethanol production improvement.'
