abstract: One of the drawbacks during second-generation biofuel production from plant
  lignocellulosic biomass is the accumulation of glucose, the preferred carbon source
  of microorganisms, which causes the repression of hydrolytic enzyme secretion by
  industrially relevant filamentous fungi. Glucose sensing, subsequent transport and
  cellular signalling pathways have been barely elucidated in these organisms. This
  study therefore characterized the transcriptional response of the filamentous fungus
  Aspergillus nidulans to the presence of high and low glucose concentrations under
  continuous chemostat cultivation with the aim to identify novel factors involved
  in glucose sensing and signalling. Several transcription factor- and transporter-encoding
  genes were identified as being differentially regulated, including the previously
  characterized glucose and xylose transporter HxtB. HxtB was confirmed to be a low
  affinity glucose transporter, localizing to the plasma membrane under low- and high-glucose
  conditions. Furthermore, HxtB was shown to be involved in conidiation-related processes
  and may play a role in downstream glucose signalling. A gene predicted to encode
  the protein kinase PskA was also identified as being important for glucose metabolism.
  This study identified several proteins with predicted roles in glucose metabolic
  processes and provides a foundation for further investigation into the response
  of biotechnologically important filamentous fungi to glucose.
