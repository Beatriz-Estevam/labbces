abstract: "BACKGROUND: Sugarcane is one of the world's most profitable crops. Waste\
  \ steam-exploded sugarcane bagasse (SEB) is a cheap, abundant, and renewable lignocellulosic\
  \ feedstock for the next-generation biofuels. In nature, fungi seldom exist as planktonic\
  \ cells, similar to those found in the nutrient-rich environment created within\
  \ an industrial fermenter. Instead, fungi predominantly form biofilms that allow\
  \ them to thrive in hostile environments. RESULTS: In turn, we adopted an RNA-sequencing\
  \ approach to interrogate how the model fungus, Aspergillus nidulans, adapts to\
  \ SEB, revealing the induction of carbon starvation responses and the lignocellulolytic\
  \ machinery, in addition to morphological adaptations. Genetic analyses showed the\
  \ importance of hydrophobins for growth on SEB. The major hydrophobin, RodA, was\
  \ retained within the fungal biofilm on SEB fibres. The StuA transcription factor\
  \ that regulates fungal morphology was up-regulated during growth on SEB and controlled\
  \ hydrophobin gene induction. The absence of the RodA or DewC hydrophobins reduced\
  \ biofilm formation. The loss of a RodA or a functional StuA reduced the retention\
  \ of the hydrolytic enzymes within the vicinity of the fungus. Hence, hydrophobins\
  \ promote biofilm formation on SEB, and may enhance lignocellulose utilisation via\
  \ promoting a compact substrate-enzyme-fungus structure. CONCLUSION: This novel\
  \ study highlights the importance of hydrophobins to the formation of biofilms and\
  \ the efficient deconstruction of lignocellulose."
