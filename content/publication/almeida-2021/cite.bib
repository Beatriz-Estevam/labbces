 abstract = {Mitochondrial genomes are highly conserved in many fungal groups, and they can help characterize the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary biology of plant pathogenic fungi. Rust fungi are among the most devastating diseases for economically important crops around the world. Here, we report the complete sequence and annotation of the mitochondrial genome of Austropuccinia psidii (syn. Puccinia psidii), the causal agent of myrtle rust. We performed a phylogenomic analysis including the complete mitochondrial sequences from other rust fungi. The genome composed of 93.299 bp has 73 predicted genes, 33 of which encoded nonconserved proteins (ncORFs), representing almost 45% of all predicted genes. A. psidii mtDNA is one of the largest rust mtDNA sequenced to date, most likely due to the abundance of ncORFs. Among them, 33% were within intronic regions of diverse intron groups. Mobile genetic elements invading intron sequences may have played significant roles in size but not shaping of the rust mitochondrial genome structure. The mtDNAs from rust fungi are highly syntenic. Phylogenetic inferences with 14 concatenated mitochondrial proteins encoded by the core genes placed A. psidii according to phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rDNA. Interestingly, cox1, the gene with the greatest number of introns, provided phylogenies not congruent with the core set. For the first time, we identified the proteins encoded by three A. psidii ncORFs using proteomics analyses. Also, the orf208 encoded a transmembrane protein repressed during in vitro morphogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, we presented the first report of a complete mtDNA sequence of a member of the family Sphaerophragmiacea.},
