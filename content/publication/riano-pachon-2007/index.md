abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Transcription factors (TFs) are key regulatory proteins that
  enhance or repress the transcriptional rate of their target genes by binding to
  specific promoter regions (i.e. cis-acting elements) upon activation or de-activation
  of upstream signaling cascades. TFs thus constitute master control elements of dynamic
  transcriptional networks. TFs have fundamental roles in almost all biological processes
  (development, growth and response to environmental factors) and it is assumed that
  they play immensely important functions in the evolution of species. In plants,
  TFs have been employed to manipulate various types of metabolic, developmental and
  stress response pathways. Cross-species comparison and identification of regulatory
  modules and hence TFs is thought to become increasingly important for the rational
  design of new plant biomass. Up to now, however, no computational repository is
  available that provides access to the largely complete sets of transcription factors
  of sequenced plant genomes. DESCRIPTION: PlnTFDB is an integrative plant transcription
  factor database that provides a web interface to access large (close to complete)
  sets of transcription factors of several plant species, currently encompassing Arabidopsis
  thaliana (thale cress), Populus trichocarpa (poplar), Oryza sativa (rice), Chlamydomonas
  reinhardtii and Ostreococcus tauri. It also provides an access point to its daughter
  databases of a species-centered representation of transcription factors (OstreoTFDB,
  ChlamyTFDB, ArabTFDB, PoplarTFDB and RiceTFDB). Information including protein sequences,
  coding regions, genomic sequences, expressed sequence tags (ESTs), domain architecture
  and scientific literature is provided for each family. CONCLUSION: We have created
  lists of putatively complete sets of transcription factors and other transcriptional
  regulators for five plant genomes. They are publicly available through http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de.
  Further data will be included in the future when the sequences of other plant genomes
  become available.'
