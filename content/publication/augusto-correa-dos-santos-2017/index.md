abstract: 'SUMMARY: ploidyNGS is a model-free, open source tool to visualize and explore
  ploidy levels in a newly sequenced genome, exploiting short read data. We tested
  ploidyNGS using both simulated and real NGS data of the model yeast Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae. ploidyNGS allows the identification of the ploidy level of a newly sequenced
  genome in a visual way. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ploidyNGS is available
  under the GNU General Public License (GPL) at https://github.com/diriano/ploidyNGS.
  ploidyNGS is implemented in Python and R. CONTACT: diriano@gmail.com.'
