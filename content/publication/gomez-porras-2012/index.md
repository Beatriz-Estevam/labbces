abstract: As heritage from early evolution, potassium (K(+)) is absolutely necessary
  for all living cells. It plays significant roles as stabilizer in metabolism and
  is important for enzyme activation, stabilization of protein synthesis, and neutralization
  of negative charges on cellular molecules as proteins and nucleic acids. Land plants
  even enlarged this spectrum of K(+) utilization after having gone ashore, despite
  the fact that K(+) is far less available in their new oligotrophic habitats than
  in sea water. Inevitably, plant cells had to improve and to develop unique transport
  systems for K(+) accumulation and distribution. In the past two decades a manifold
  of K(+) transporters from flowering plants has been identified at the molecular
  level. The recently published genome of the fern ally Selaginella moellendorffii
  now helps in providing a better understanding on the molecular changes involved
  in the colonization of land and the development of the vasculature and the seeds.
  In this article we present an inventory of K(+) transporters of this lycophyte and
  pigeonhole them together with their relatives from the moss Physcomitrella patens,
  the monocotyledon Oryza sativa, and two dicotyledonous species, the herbaceous plant
  Arabidopsis thaliana, and the tree Populus trichocarpa. Interestingly, the transition
  of green plants from an aqueous to a dry environment coincides with a dramatic reduction
  in the diversity of voltage-gated potassium channels followed by a diversification
  on the basis of one surviving K(+) channel class. The first appearance of K(+) release
  (K(out)) channels in S. moellendorffii that were shown in Arabidopsis to be involved
  in xylem loading and guard cell closure coincides with the specialization of vascular
  plants and may indicate an important adaptive step.
