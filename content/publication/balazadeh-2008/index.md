abstract: 'Senescence is a highly regulated process, eventually leading to cell and
  tissue disintegration: a physiological process associated with nutrient (e.g. nitrogen)
  redistribution from leaves to reproductive organs. Senescence is not observed in
  young leaves, indicating that repressors efficiently act to suppress cell degradation
  during early leaf development and/or that senescence activators are switched on
  when a leaf ages. Thus, massive regulatory network re-wiring likely constitutes
  an important component of the pre-senescence process. Transcription factors (TFs)
  have been shown to be central elements of such regulatory networks. Here, we used
  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis to study the
  expression of 1880 TF genes during pre-senescence and early-senescence stages of
  leaf development, using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model. We show that the expression
  of 185 TF genes changes when leaves develop from half to fully expanded leaves and
  finally enter partial senescence. Our analysis identified 41 TF genes that were
  gradually up-regulated as leaves progressed through these developmental stages.
  We also identified 144 TF genes that were down-regulated during senescence. A considerable
  number of the senescence-regulated TF genes were found to respond to abiotic stress,
  and salt stress appeared to be the major factor controlling their expression. Our
  data indicate a peculiar fine-tuning of developmental shifts during late-leaf development
  that is controlled by TFs.'
