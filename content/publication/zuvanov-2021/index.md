abstract: Computational biology has gained traction as an independent scientific discipline
  over the last years in South America. However, there is still a growing need for
  bioscientists, from different backgrounds, with different levels, to acquire programming
  skills, which could reduce the time from data to insights and bridge communication
  between life scientists and computer scientists. Python is a programming language
  extensively used in bioinformatics and data science, which is particularly suitable
  for beginners. Here, we describe the conception, organization, and implementation
  of the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data. This workshop has been organized
  by graduate and undergraduate students and supported, mostly in administrative matters,
  by experienced faculty members since 2017. The workshop was conceived for teaching
  bioscientists, mainly students in Brazil, on how to program in a biological context.
  The goal of this article was to share our experience with the 2020 edition of the
  workshop in its virtual format due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
  and to compare and contrast this year's experience with the previous in-person editions.
  We described a hands-on and live coding workshop model for teaching introductory
  Python programming. We also highlighted the adaptations made from in-person to online
  format in 2020, the participants' assessment of learning progression, and general
  workshop management. Lastly, we provided a summary and reflections from our personal
  experiences from the workshops of the last 4 years. Our takeaways included the benefits
  of the learning from learners' feedback (LLF) that allowed us to improve the workshop
  in real time, in the short, and likely in the long term. We concluded that the Brazilian
  Python Workshop for Biological Data is a highly effective workshop model for teaching
  a programming language that allows bioscientists to go beyond an initial exploration
  of programming skills for data analysis in the medium to long term.
