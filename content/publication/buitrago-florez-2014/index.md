abstract: The biological diversity among Stramenopiles is striking; they range from
  large multicellular seaweeds to tiny unicellular species, they embrace many ecologically
  important autothrophic (e.g., diatoms, brown algae), and heterotrophic (e.g., oomycetes)
  groups. Transcription factors (TFs) and other transcription regulators (TRs) regulate
  spatial and temporal gene expression. A plethora of transcriptional regulatory proteins
  have been identified and classified into families on the basis of sequence similarity.
  The purpose of this work is to identify the TF and TR complement in diverse species
  belonging to Stramenopiles in order to understand how these regulators may contribute
  to their observed diversity. We identified and classified 63 TF and TR families
  in 11 species of Stramenopiles. In some species we found gene families with high
  relative importance. Taking into account the 63 TF and TR families identified, 28
  TF and TR families were established to be positively correlated with specific traits
  like number of predicted proteins, number of flagella and number of cell types during
  the life cycle. Additionally, we found gains and losses in TF and TR families specific
  to some species and clades, as well as, two families with high abundance specific
  to the autotrophic species and three families with high abundance specific to the
  heterotropic species. For the first time, there is a systematic search of TF and
  TR families in Stramenopiles. The attempts to uncover relationships between these
  families and the complexity of this group may be of great impact, considering that
  there are several important pathogens of plants and animals, as well as, important
  species involved in carbon cycling. Specific TF and TR families identified in this
  work appear to be correlated with particular traits in the Stramenopiles group and
  may be correlated with the high complexity and diversity in Stramenopiles.
