abstract: The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase pathway integrates energy and nutrient
  availability into metabolism promoting growth in eukaryotes. The overall higher
  efficiency on nutrient use translated into faster growth rates in C  grass plants
  led to the investigation of differential transcriptional and metabolic responses
  to short-term chemical TOR complex (TORC) suppression in the model  . In addition
  to previously described responses to TORC inhibition (i.e., general growth arrest,
  translational repression, and primary metabolism reprogramming) in   (C ), the magnitude
  of changes was smaller in  , particularly regarding nutrient use efficiency and
  C allocation and partitioning that promote biosynthetic growth. Besides photosynthetic
  differences,   and   present several specificities that classify them into distinct
  lineages, which also contribute to the observed alterations mediated by TOR. Indeed,
  cell wall metabolism seems to be distinctly regulated according to each cell wall
  type, as synthesis of non-pectic polysaccharides were affected in  , whilst assembly
  and structure in   Our results indicate that the metabolic network needed to achieve
  faster growth seems to be less stringently controlled by TORC in  .
