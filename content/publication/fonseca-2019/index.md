abstract: We report on the nearly complete genome sequence of Clostridium beijerinckii
  strain Br21, formerly isolated from a sugarcarne vinasse wastewater treatment plant.
  The resulting genome is ca. 5.9 Mbp in length and resembles the size of previously
  published C. beijerinckii genomes. We annotated the genome sequence and predicted
  a total of 5323 genes. Strain Br21 has a genetic toolkit that allows it to exploit
  diverse sugars that are often found after lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment to
  yield products of commercial interest. Besides the whole set of genes encoding for
  enzymes underlying hydrogen production, the genome of the new strain includes genes
  that enable carbon sources conversion into butanol, ethanol, acetic acid, butyric
  acid, and the chemical block 1,3-propanediol, which is used to obtain polymers.
  Moreover, the genome of strain Br21 has a higher number of ORFs with predicted beta-glucosidase
  activity as compared to other C. beijerinckii strains described in the KEGG database.
  These characteristics make C. beijerinckii strain Br21 a remarkable candidate for
  direct use in biotechnological processes and attest that it is a potential biocatalyst
  supplier.
