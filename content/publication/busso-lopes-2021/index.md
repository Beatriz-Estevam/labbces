abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has high mortality rates that are largely
  associated with lymph node metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive
  OSCC metastasis are unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound particles
  that play a role in intercellular communication and impact cancer development and
  progression. Thus, profiling EVs would be of great significance to decipher their
  role in OSCC metastasis. For that purpose, we used a reductionist approach to map
  the proteomic, miRNA, metabolomic, and lipidomic profiles of EVs derived from human
  primary tumor (SCC-9) cells and matched lymph node metastatic (LN1) cells. Distinct
  omics profiles were associated with the metastatic phenotype, including 670 proteins,
  217 miRNAs, 26 metabolites, and 63 lipids differentially abundant between LN1 cell-
  and SCC-9 cell-derived EVs. A multi-omics integration identified 11 'hub proteins'
  significantly decreased at the metastatic site compared with primary tumor-derived
  EVs. We confirmed the validity of these findings with analysis of data from multiple
  public databases and found that low abundance of seven 'hub proteins' in EVs from
  metastatic lymph nodes (ALDH7A1, CAD, CANT1, GOT1, MTHFD1, PYGB, and SARS) is correlated
  with reduced survival and tumor aggressiveness in patients with cancer. In summary,
  this multi-omics approach identified proteins transported by EVs that are associated
  with metastasis and which may potentially serve as prognostic markers in OSCC.
