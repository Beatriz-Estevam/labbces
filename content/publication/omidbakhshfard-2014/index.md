abstract: The control of gene expression by transcriptional regulators and other types
  of functionally relevant DNA transactions such as chromatin remodeling and replication
  underlie a vast spectrum of biological processes in all organisms. DNA transactions
  require the controlled interaction of proteins with DNA sequence motifs which are
  often located in nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) of the chromatin. Formaldehyde-assisted
  isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) has been established as an easy-to-implement
  method for the isolation of NDRs from a number of eukaryotic organisms, and it has
  been successfully employed for the discovery of new regulatory segments in genomic
  DNA from, for example, yeast, Drosophila, and humans. Until today, however, FAIRE
  has only rarely been employed in plant research and currently no detailed FAIRE
  protocol for plants has been published. Here, we provide a step-by-step FAIRE protocol
  for NDR discovery in Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate that NDRs isolated from
  plant chromatin are readily amenable to quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
  next-generation sequencing. Only minor modification of the FAIRE protocol will be
  needed to adapt it to other plants, thus facilitating the global inventory of regulatory
  regions across species.
