abstract: The development of microalgae sustainable applications needs better understanding
  of microalgae biology. Moreover, how cells coordinate their metabolism toward biomass
  accumulation is not fully understood. In this present study, flux balance analysis
  (FBA) was performed to identify sensitive metabolic pathways of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
  under varied CO2 inputs. The metabolic network model of Chlamydomonas was updated
  based on the genome annotation data and sensitivity analysis revealed CO2 sensitive
  reactions. Biological experiments were performed with cells cultivated at 0.04%
  (air), 2.5, 5, 8, and 10% CO2 concentration under controlled conditions and cell
  growth profiles and biomass content were measured. Pigments, lipids, proteins, and
  starch were further quantified for the reference low (0.04%) and high (10%) CO2
  conditions. The expression level of candidate genes of sensitive reactions was measured
  and validated by quantitative real time PCR. The sensitive analysis revealed mitochondrial
  compartment as the major affected by changes on the CO2 concentrations and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis,
  glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate metabolism among the affected metabolic pathways.
  Genes coding for glycerate kinase (GLYK), glycine cleavage system, H-protein (GCSH),
  NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (MDH3), low-CO2 inducible protein A (LCIA), carbonic
  anhydrase 5 (CAH5), E1 component, alpha subunit (PDC3), dual function alcohol dehydrogenase/acetaldehyde
  dehydrogenase (ADH1), and phosphoglucomutase (GPM2), were defined, among other genes,
  as sensitive nodes in the metabolic network simulations. These genes were experimentally
  responsive to the changes in the carbon fluxes in the system. We performed metabolomics
  analysis using mass spectrometry validating the modulation of carbon dioxide responsive
  pathways and metabolites. The changes on CO2 levels mostly affected the metabolism
  of amino acids found in the photorespiration pathway. Our updated metabolic network
  was compared to previous model and it showed more consistent results once considering
  the experimental data. Possible roles of the sensitive pathways in the biomass metabolism
  are discussed.
