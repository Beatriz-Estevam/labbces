abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Medium- to large-scale expression profiling using quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays are becoming increasingly important in genomics
  research. A major bottleneck in experiment preparation is the design of specific
  primer pairs, where researchers have to make several informed choices, often outside
  their area of expertise. Using currently available primer design tools, several
  interactive decisions have to be made, resulting in lengthy design processes with
  varying qualities of the assays. RESULTS: Here we present QuantPrime, an intuitive
  and user-friendly, fully automated tool for primer pair design in small- to large-scale
  qPCR analyses. QuantPrime can be used online through the internet http://www.quantprime.de/
  or on a local computer after download; it offers design and specificity checking
  with highly customizable parameters and is ready to use with many publicly available
  transcriptomes of important higher eukaryotic model organisms and plant crops (currently
  295 species in total), while benefiting from exon-intron border and alternative
  splice variant information in available genome annotations. Experimental results
  with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the crop Hordeum vulgare and the model
  green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii show success rates of designed primer pairs
  exceeding 96%. CONCLUSION: QuantPrime constitutes a flexible, fully automated web
  application for reliable primer design for use in larger qPCR experiments, as proven
  by experimental data. The flexible framework is also open for simple use in other
  quantification applications, such as hydrolyzation probe design for qPCR and oligonucleotide
  probe design for quantitative in situ hybridization. Future suggestions made by
  users can be easily implemented, thus allowing QuantPrime to be developed into a
  broad-range platform for the design of RNA expression assays.'
