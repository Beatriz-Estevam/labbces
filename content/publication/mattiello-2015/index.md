abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Sugarcane is one of the major crops worldwide. It is cultivated
  in over 100 countries on 22 million ha. The complex genetic architecture and the
  lack of a complete genomic sequence in sugarcane hamper the adoption of molecular
  approaches to study its physiology and to develop new varieties. Investments on
  the development of new sugarcane varieties have been made to maximize sucrose yield,
  a trait dependent on photosynthetic capacity. However, detailed studies on sugarcane
  leaves are scarce. In this work, we report the first molecular and physiological
  characterization of events taking place along a leaf developmental gradient in sugarcane.
  RESULTS: Photosynthetic response to CO2 indicated divergence in photosynthetic capacity
  based on PEPcase activity, corroborated by activity quantification (both in vivo
  and in vitro) and distinct levels of carbon discrimination on different segments
  along leaf length. Additionally, leaf segments had contrasting amount of chlorophyll,
  nitrogen and sugars. RNA-Seq data indicated a plethora of biochemical pathways differentially
  expressed along the leaf. Some transcription factors families were enriched on each
  segment and their putative functions corroborate with the distinct developmental
  stages. Several genes with higher expression in the middle segment, the one with
  the highest photosynthetic rates, were identified and their role in sugarcane productivity
  is discussed. Interestingly, sugarcane leaf segments had a different transcriptional
  behavior compared to previously published data from maize. CONCLUSION: This is the
  first report of leaf developmental analysis in sugarcane. Our data on sugarcane
  is another source of information for further studies aiming to understand and/or
  improve C4 photosynthesis. The segments used in this work were distinct in their
  physiological status allowing deeper molecular analysis. Although limited in some
  aspects, the comparison to maize indicates that all data acquired on one C4 species
  cannot always be easily extrapolated to other species. However, our data indicates
  that some transcriptional factors were segment-specific and the sugarcane leaf undergoes
  through the process of suberizarion, photosynthesis establishment and senescence.'
