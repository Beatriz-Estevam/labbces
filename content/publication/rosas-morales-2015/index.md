abstract: Genomes from four Clostridium sp. strains considered to be mesophilic anaerobic
  bacteria, isolated from crop soil in Colombia, with a strong potential to produce
  alcohols like 1,3-propanediol, were analyzed. We present the draft genome of these
  strains, which will be useful for developing genetic engineering strategies.
