abstract: Here, we present the nuclear and mitochondrial genome sequences of Pseudozyma
  brasiliensis sp. nov. strain GHG001. P. brasiliensis sp. nov. is the closest relative
  of Pseudozyma vetiver. P. brasiliensis sp. nov. is capable of growing on xylose
  or xylan as a sole carbon source and has great biotechnological potential.
