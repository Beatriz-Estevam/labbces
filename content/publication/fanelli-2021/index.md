abstract: The purification of hydroxycinnamic acids [ -coumaric acid ( CA) and ferulic
  acid (FA)] from grass cell walls requires high-cost processes. Feedstocks with increased
  levels of one hydroxycinnamate in preference to the other are therefore highly desirable.
  We identified and conducted expression analysis for nine BAHD acyltransferase   genes
  from sugarcane. The high conservation of AT10 proteins, together with their similar
  gene expression patterns, supported a similar role in distinct grasses. Overexpression
  of   in maize resulted in up to 75% increase in total  CA content. Mild hydrolysis
  and derivatization followed by reductive cleavage (DFRC) analysis showed that  CA
  increase was restricted to the hemicellulosic portion of the cell wall. Furthermore,
  total FA content was reduced up to 88%, resulting in a 10-fold increase in the  CA/FA
  ratio. Thus, we functionally characterized a sugarcane gene involved in  CA content
  on hemicelluloses and generated a C4 plant that is promising for valorizing  CA
  production in biorefineries.
