abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Using globally abundant crop residues as a carbon source for
  energy generation and renewable chemicals production stand out as a promising solution
  to reduce current dependency on fossil fuels. In nature, such as in compost habitats,
  microbial communities efficiently degrade the available plant biomass using a diverse
  set of synergistic enzymes. However, deconstruction of lignocellulose remains a
  challenge for industry due to recalcitrant nature of the substrate and the inefficiency
  of the enzyme systems available, making the economic production of lignocellulosic
  biofuels difficult. Metatranscriptomic studies of microbial communities can unveil
  the metabolic functions employed by lignocellulolytic consortia and identify novel biocatalysts
  that could improve industrial lignocellulose conversion. RESULTS: In this study,
  a microbial community from compost was grown in minimal medium with sugarcane bagasse
  sugarcane bagasse as the sole carbon source. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance
  was used to monitor lignocellulose degradation; analysis of metatranscriptomic data
  led to the selection and functional characterization of several target genes, revealing
  the first glycoside hydrolase from Carbohydrate Active Enzyme family 11 with exo-1,4-β-xylanase
  activity. The xylanase crystal structure was resolved at 1.76 Å revealing the structural
  basis of exo-xylanase activity. Supplementation of a commercial cellulolytic enzyme
  cocktail with the xylanase showed improvement in Avicel hydrolysis in the presence
  of inhibitory xylooligomers. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that composting
  microbiomes continue to be an excellent source of biotechnologically important enzymes
  by unveiling the diversity of enzymes involved in in situ lignocellulose degradation.'
