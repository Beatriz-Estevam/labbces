abstract: 'Metal restriction imposed by mammalian hosts during an infection is a common
  mechanism of defence to reduce or avoid the pathogen infection. Metals are essential
  for organism survival due to its involvement in several biological processes. Aspergillus
  fumigatus causes invasive aspergillosis, a disease that typically manifests in immunocompromised
  patients. A. fumigatus PpzA, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase Z (PPZ),
  has been recently identified as associated with iron assimilation. A. fumigatus
  has 2 high-affinity mechanisms of iron acquisition during infection: reductive iron
  assimilation and siderophore-mediated iron uptake. It has been shown that siderophore
  production is important for A. fumigatus virulence, differently to the reductive
  iron uptake system. Transcriptomic and proteomic comparisons between ∆ppzA and wild-type
  strains under iron starvation showed that PpzA has a broad influence on genes involved
  in secondary metabolism. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry under standard
  and iron starvation conditions confirmed that the ΔppzA mutant had reduced production
  of pyripyropene A, fumagillin, fumiquinazoline A, triacetyl-fusarinine C, and helvolic
  acid. The ΔppzA was shown to be avirulent in a neutropenic murine model of invasive
  pulmonary aspergillosis. PpzA plays an important role at the interface between iron
  starvation, regulation of SM production, and pathogenicity in A. fumigatus.'
