 abstract = {Pseudocercospora ulei is the causal agent of South American Leaf Blight (SALB), the main disease affecting Hevea brasiliensis rubber tree, a native species to the Amazon. Rubber tree is a major crop in South American countries and SALB disease control strategies would benefit from the availability of genomic resources for the fungal pathogen. Here, we assembled and annotated the P. ulei genome. Shotgun sequencing was performed using second and third generation sequencing technologies. We present the first P. ulei high-quality genome assembly, the largest among Mycosphaerellaceae, with 93.8 Mbp, comprising 215 scaffolds, an N50 of 2.8 Mbp and a BUSCO gene completeness of 97.5%. We identified 12,745 protein-coding gene models in the P. ulei genome with 756 genes encoding secreted proteins and 113 genes encoding effector candidates. Most of the genome (80%) is composed of repetitive elements dominated by retrotransposons of the Gypsy superfamily. P. ulei has the largest genome size among Mycosphaerellaceae, with the highest TE content. In conclusion, we have established essential genomic resources for a wide range of studies on P. ulei and related species.},
