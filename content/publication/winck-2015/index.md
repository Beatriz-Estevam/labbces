abstract: The development and progression of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)
  involves complex cellular mechanisms that contribute to the low five-year survival
  rate of approximately 20% among diagnosed patients. However, the biological processes
  essential to tumor progression are not completely understood. Therefore, detecting
  alterations in the salivary proteome may assist in elucidating the cellular mechanisms
  modulated in OSCC and improve the clinical prognosis of the disease. The proteome
  of whole saliva and salivary extracellular vesicles (EVs) from patients with OSCC
  and healthy individuals were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and label-free protein quantification.
  Proteome data analysis was performed using statistical, machine learning and feature
  selection methods with additional functional annotation. Biological processes related
  to immune responses, peptidase inhibitor activity, iron coordination and protease
  binding were overrepresented in the group of differentially expressed proteins.
  Proteins related to the inflammatory system, transport of metals and cellular growth
  and proliferation were identified in the proteome of salivary EVs. The proteomics
  data were robust and could classify OSCC with 90% accuracy. The saliva proteome
  analysis revealed that immune processes are related to the presence of OSCC and
  indicate that proteomics data can contribute to determining OSCC prognosis.
