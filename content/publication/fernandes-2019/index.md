abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Pythium irregulare is an oleaginous Oomycete able to accumulate
  large amounts of lipids, including Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). EPA is an important
  and expensive dietary supplement with a promising and very competitive market, which
  is dependent on fish-oil extraction. This has prompted several research groups to
  study biotechnological routes to obtain specific fatty acids rather than a mixture
  of various lipids. Moreover, microorganisms can use low cost carbon sources for
  lipid production, thus reducing production costs. Previous studies have highlighted
  the production of EPA by P. irregulare, exploiting diverse low cost carbon sources
  that are produced in large amounts, such as vinasse, glycerol, and food wastewater.
  However, there is still a lack of knowledge about its biosynthetic pathways, because
  no functional annotation of any Pythium sp. exists yet. The goal of this work was
  to identify key genes and pathways related to EPA biosynthesis, in P. irregulare
  CBS 494.86, by sequencing and performing an unprecedented annotation of its genome,
  considering the possibility of using wastewater as a carbon source. RESULTS: Genome
  sequencing provided 17,727 candidate genes, with 3809 of them associated with enzyme
  code and 945 with membrane transporter proteins. The functional annotation was compared
  with curated information of oleaginous organisms, understanding amino acids and
  fatty acids production, and consumption of carbon and nitrogen sources, present
  in the wastewater. The main features include the presence of genes related to the
  consumption of several sugars and candidate genes of unsaturated fatty acids production.
  CONCLUSIONS: The whole metabolic genome presented, which is an unprecedented reconstruction
  of P. irregulare CBS 494.86, shows its potential to produce value-added products,
  in special EPA, for food and pharmaceutical industries, moreover it infers metabolic
  capabilities of the microorganism by incorporating information obtained from literature
  and genomic data, supplying information of great importance to future work.'
