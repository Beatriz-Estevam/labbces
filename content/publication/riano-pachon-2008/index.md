abstract: Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by interacting with
  cis-elements in target gene promoters. Transcription regulators (TRs) assist in
  controlling gene expression through interaction with TFs, chromatin remodeling,
  or other mechanisms. Both types of proteins thus constitute master controllers of
  dynamic transcriptional networks. To uncover such control elements in the photosynthetic
  green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we performed a comprehensive analysis of its
  genome sequence. In total, we identified 234 genes encoding 147 TFs and 87 TRs of
  approximately 40 families. The set of putative TFs and TRs, including their transcript
  and protein sequences, domain architectures, and supporting information about putative
  orthologs, is available at http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v2.0/. Twelve of 34
  plant-specific TF families were found in at least one algal species, indicating
  their early evolutionary origin. Twenty-two plant-specific TF families and one plant-specific
  TR family were not observed in algae, suggesting their specific association with
  developmental or physiological processes characteristic to multicellular plants.
  We also analyzed the occurrence of proteins that constitute the light-regulated
  transcriptional network in angiosperms and found putative algal orthologs for most
  of them. Our analysis provides a solid ground for future experimental studies aiming
  at deciphering the transcriptional regulatory networks in green algae.
