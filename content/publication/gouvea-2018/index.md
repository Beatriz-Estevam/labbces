abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Sugarcane bagasse has been proposed as a lignocellulosic residue
  for second-generation ethanol (2G) produced by breaking down biomass into fermentable
  sugars. The enzymatic cocktails for biomass degradation are mostly produced by fungi,
  but low cost and high efficiency can consolidate 2G technologies. A. fumigatus plays
  an important role in plant biomass degradation capabilities and recycling. To gain
  more insight into the divergence in gene expression during steam-exploded bagasse
  (SEB) breakdown, this study profiled the transcriptome of A. fumigatus by RNA sequencing
  to compare transcriptional profiles of A. fumigatus grown on media containing SEB
  or fructose as the sole carbon source. Secretome analysis was also performed using
  SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: The maximum activities of cellulases (0.032 U mL-1),
  endo-1,4-β--xylanase (10.82 U mL-1) and endo-1,3-β glucanases (0.77 U mL-1) showed
  that functional CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes) were secreted in the SEB culture
  conditions. Correlations between transcriptome and secretome data identified several
  CAZymes in A. fumigatus. Particular attention was given to CAZymes related to lignocellulose
  degradation and sugar transporters. Genes encoding glycoside hydrolase classes commonly
  expressed during the breakdown of cellulose, such as GH-5, 6, 7, 43, 45, and hemicellulose,
  such as GH-2, 10, 11, 30, 43, were found to be highly expressed in SEB conditions.
  Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMO) classified as auxiliary activity families
  AA9 (GH61), CE (1, 4, 8, 15, 16), PL (1, 3, 4, 20) and GT (1, 2, 4, 8, 20, 35, 48)
  were also differentially expressed in this condition. Similarly, the most important
  enzymes related to biomass degradation, including endoxylanases, xyloglucanases,
  β-xylosidases, LPMOs, α-arabinofuranosidases, cellobiohydrolases, endoglucanases
  and β-glucosidases, were also identified in the secretome. CONCLUSIONS: This is
  the first report of a transcriptome and secretome experiment of Aspergillus fumigatus
  in the degradation of pretreated sugarcane bagasse. The results suggest that this
  strain employs important strategies for this complex degradation process. It was
  possible to identify a set of genes and proteins that might be applied in several
  biotechnology fields. This knowledge can be exploited for the improvement of 2G
  ethanol production by the rational design of enzymatic cocktails.'
