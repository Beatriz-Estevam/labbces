abstract: Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes are key enzymes for biomass-to-bioproducts conversion.
  α-l-Arabinofuranosidases that belong to the Glycoside Hydrolase family 62 (GH62)
  have important applications in biofuel production from plant biomass by hydrolyzing
  arabinoxylans, found in both the primary and secondary cell walls of plants. In
  this work, we identified a GH62 α-l-arabinofuranosidase (AnAbf62A(wt)) that was
  highly secreted when Aspergillus nidulans was cultivated on sugarcane bagasse. The
  gene AN7908 was cloned and transformed in A. nidulans for homologous production
  of AnAbf62A(wt), and we confirmed that the enzyme is N-glycosylated at asparagine
  83 by mass spectrometry analysis. The enzyme was also expressed in Escherichia coli
  and the studies of circular dichroism showed that the melting temperature and structural
  profile of AnAbf62A(wt) and the non-glycosylated enzyme from E. coli (AnAbf62A(deglyc))
  were highly similar. In addition, the designed glycomutant AnAbf62A(N83Q) presented
  similar patterns of secretion and activity to the AnAbf62A(wt), indicating that
  the N-glycan does not influence the properties of this enzyme. The crystallographic
  structure of AnAbf62A(deglyc) was obtained and the 1.7Å resolution model showed
  a five-bladed β-propeller fold, which is conserved in family GH62. Mutants AnAbf62A(Y312F)
  and AnAbf62A(Y312S) showed that Y312 was an important substrate-binding residue.
  Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the loop containing Y312 could access
  different conformations separated by moderately low energy barriers. One of these
  conformations, comprising a local minimum, is responsible for placing Y312 in the
  vicinity of the arabinose glycosidic bond, and thus, may be important for catalytic
  efficiency.
