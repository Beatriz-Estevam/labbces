abstract: Witches' broom disease of cacao is caused by the pathogenic fungus Moniliophthora
  perniciosa. By using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cultivar Micro-Tom (MT) as a
  model system, we investigated the physiological and metabolic consequences of M.
  perniciosa infection to determine whether symptoms result from sink establishment
  during infection. Infection of MT by M. perniciosa caused reductions in root biomass
  and fruit yield, a decrease in leaf gas exchange, and down-regulation of photosynthesis-related
  genes. The total leaf area and water potential decreased, while ABA levels, water
  conductance/conductivity, and ABA-related gene expression increased. Genes related
  to sugar metabolism and those involved in secondary cell wall deposition were up-regulated
  upon infection, and the concentrations of sugars, fumarate, and amino acids increased.
  14C-glucose was mobilized towards infected MT stems, but not in inoculated stems
  of the MT line overexpressing CYTOKININ OXIDASE-2 (35S::AtCKX2), suggesting a role
  for cytokinin in establishing a sugar sink. The up-regulation of genes involved
  in cell wall deposition and phenylpropanoid metabolism in infected MT, but not in
  35S::AtCKX2 plants, suggests establishment of a cytokinin-mediated sink that promotes
  tissue overgrowth with an increase in lignin. Possibly, M. perniciosa could benefit
  from the accumulation of secondary cell walls during its saprotrophic phase of infection.
