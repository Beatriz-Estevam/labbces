 abstract = {NAC proteins are one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors (TFs). They regulate diverse complex biological processes, including secondary xylem differentiation and wood formation. Recent genomic and transcriptomic studies of Tectona grandis L.f. (teak), one of the most valuable hardwood trees in the world, have allowed identification and analysis of developmental genes. In the present work, T. grandis NAC genes were identified and analyzed regarding to their evolution and expression profile during wood formation. We analyzed the recently published T. grandis genome, and identified 130 NAC proteins that are coded by 107 gene loci. These proteins were classified into 23 clades of the NAC family, together with Populus, Eucalyptus, and Arabidopsis. Data on transcript expression revealed specific temporal and spatial expression patterns for the majority of teak NAC genes. RT-PCR indicated expression of VND genes (Tg11g04450-VND2 and Tg15g08390-VND4) related to secondary cell wall formation in xylem vessels of 16-year-old juvenile trees. Our findings open a way to further understanding of NAC transcription factor genes in T. grandis wood biosynthesis, while they are potentially useful for future studies aiming to improve biomass and wood quality using biotechnological approaches.},
