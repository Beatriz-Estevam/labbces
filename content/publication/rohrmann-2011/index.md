abstract: Maturation of fleshy fruits such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is subject
  to tight genetic control. Here we describe the development of a quantitative real-time
  PCR platform that allows accurate quantification of the expression level of approximately
  1000 tomato transcription factors. In addition to utilizing this novel approach,
  we performed cDNA microarray analysis and metabolite profiling of primary and secondary
  metabolites using GC-MS and LC-MS, respectively. We applied these platforms to pericarp
  material harvested throughout fruit development, studying both wild-type Solanum
  lycopersicum cv. Ailsa Craig and the hp1 mutant. This mutant is functionally deficient
  in the tomato homologue of the negative regulator of the light signal transduction
  gene DDB1 from Arabidopsis, and is furthermore characterized by dramatically increased
  pigment and phenolic contents. We choose this particular mutant as it had previously
  been shown to have dramatic alterations in the content of several important fruit
  metabolites but relatively little impact on other ripening phenotypes. The combined
  dataset was mined in order to identify metabolites that were under the control of
  these transcription factors, and, where possible, the respective transcriptional
  regulation underlying this control. The results are discussed in terms of both programmed
  fruit ripening and development and the transcriptional and metabolic shifts that
  occur in parallel during these processes.
