abstract: Electrophysiological analyses conducted about 25 years ago detected two
  types of anion channels in the plasma membrane of guard cells. One type of channel
  responds slowly to changes in membrane voltage while the other responds quickly.
  Consequently, they were named SLAC, for SLow Anion Channel, and QUAC, for QUick
  Anion Channel. Recently, genes SLAC1 and QUAC1/ALMT12, underlying the two different
  anion current components, could be identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
  Expression of the gene products in Xenopus oocytes confirmed the quick and slow
  current kinetics. In this study we provide an overview on our current knowledge
  on slow and quick anion channels in plants and analyze the molecular evolution of
  ALMT/QUAC-like and SLAC-like channels. We discovered fingerprints that allow screening
  databases for these channel types and were able to identify 192 (177 non-redundant)
  SLAC-like and 422 (402 non-redundant) ALMT/QUAC-like proteins in the fully sequenced
  genomes of 32 plant species. Phylogenetic analyses provided new insights into the
  molecular evolution of these channel types. We also combined sequence alignment
  and clustering with predictions of protein features, leading to the identification
  of known conserved phosphorylation sites in SLAC1-like channels along with potential
  sites that have not been yet experimentally confirmed. Using a similar strategy
  to analyze the hydropathicity of ALMT/QUAC-like channels, we propose a modified
  topology with additional transmembrane regions that integrates structure and function
  of these membrane proteins. Our results suggest that cross-referencing phylogenetic
  analyses with position-specific protein properties and functional data could be
  a very powerful tool for genome research approaches in general.
