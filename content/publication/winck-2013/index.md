abstract: The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a long-established
  model organism for studies on photosynthesis and carbon metabolism-related physiology.
  Under conditions of air-level carbon dioxide concentration [CO2], a carbon concentrating
  mechanism (CCM) is induced to facilitate cellular carbon uptake. CCM increases the
  availability of carbon dioxide at the site of cellular carbon fixation. To improve
  our understanding of the transcriptional control of the CCM, we employed FAIRE-seq
  (formaldehyde-assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements, followed by deep sequencing)
  to determine nucleosome-depleted chromatin regions of algal cells subjected to carbon
  deprivation. Our FAIRE data recapitulated the positions of known regulatory elements
  in the promoter of the periplasmic carbonic anhydrase (Cah1) gene, which is upregulated
  during CCM induction, and revealed new candidate regulatory elements at a genome-wide
  scale. In addition, time series expression patterns of 130 transcription factor
  (TF) and transcription regulator (TR) genes were obtained for cells cultured under
  photoautotrophic condition and subjected to a shift from high to low [CO2]. Groups
  of co-expressed genes were identified and a putative directed gene-regulatory network
  underlying the CCM was reconstructed from the gene expression data using the recently
  developed IOTA (inner composition alignment) method. Among the candidate regulatory
  genes, two members of the MYB-related TF family, Lcr1 (Low-CO 2 response regulator
  1) and Lcr2 (Low-CO2 response regulator 2), may play an important role in down-regulating
  the expression of a particular set of TF and TR genes in response to low [CO2].
  The results obtained provide new insights into the transcriptional control of the
  CCM and revealed more than 60 new candidate regulatory genes. Deep sequencing of
  nucleosome-depleted genomic regions indicated the presence of new, previously unknown
  regulatory elements in the C. reinhardtii genome. Our work can serve as a basis
  for future functional studies of transcriptional regulator genes and genomic regulatory
  elements in Chlamydomonas.
