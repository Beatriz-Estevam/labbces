 abstract = {Dirigent (DIR) proteins, encoded by DIR genes, are referred to as "dirigent" because they direct the outcome of the coupling of the monolignol coniferyl alcohol into (+) or (-) pinoresinol, the first intermediates in the enantiocomplementary pathways for lignan biosynthesis. DIR domain-containing or DIR-like proteins are, thus, termed for not having a clear characterization. A transcriptome- and genome-wide survey of DIR domain-containing proteins in sugarcane was carried out, in addition to phylogenetic, physicochemical and transcriptional analyses. A total of 120 non-redundant sequences containing the DIR domain were identified and classified into 64 groups according to phylogenetic and sequence alignment analyses. In silico analysis of transcript abundance showed that these sequences are expressed at low levels in leaves and genes in the same phylogenetic clade have similar expression patterns. Expression analysis of ShDIR1-like transcripts in the culm internodes of sugarcane demonstrates their abundance in mature internodes, their induction by nitrogen fertilization and their predominant expression in cells that have a lignified secondary cell wall, such as vascular bundles of young internodes and parenchymal cells of the pith of mature internodes. Due to the lack of information about the functional role of DIR in plants, a possible relationship is discussed between the ShDIR1-like transcriptional profile and cell wall development in parenchyma cells of sugarcane culm, which typically accumulates large amounts of sucrose. The number of genes encoding the DIR domain-containing proteins in sugarcane is intriguing and is an indication per se that these proteins may have an important metabolic role and thus deserve to be better studied.},
