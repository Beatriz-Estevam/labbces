abstract: Coffee leaf rust caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix is the most damaging
  disease to coffee worldwide. The pathogen has recently appeared in multiple outbreaks
  in coffee producing countries resulting in significant yield losses and increases
  in costs related to its control. New races/isolates are constantly emerging as evidenced
  by the presence of the fungus in plants that were previously resistant. Genomic
  studies are opening new avenues for the study of the evolution of pathogens, the
  detailed description of plant-pathogen interactions and the development of molecular
  techniques for the identification of individual isolates. For this purpose we sequenced
  8 different H. vastatrix isolates using NGS technologies and gathered partial genome
  assemblies due to the large repetitive content in the coffee rust hybrid genome;
  74.4% of the assembled contigs harbor repetitive sequences. A hybrid assembly of
  333 Mb was built based on the 8 isolates; this assembly was used for subsequent
  analyses. Analysis of the conserved gene space showed that the hybrid H. vastatrix
  genome, though highly fragmented, had a satisfactory level of completion with 91.94%
  of core protein-coding orthologous genes present. RNA-Seq from urediniospores was
  used to guide the de novo annotation of the H. vastatrix gene complement. In total,
  14,445 genes organized in 3921 families were uncovered; a considerable proportion
  of the predicted proteins (73.8%) were homologous to other Pucciniales species genomes.
  Several gene families related to the fungal lifestyle were identified, particularly
  483 predicted secreted proteins that represent candidate effector genes and will
  provide interesting hints to decipher virulence in the coffee rust fungus. The genome
  sequence of Hva will serve as a template to understand the molecular mechanisms
  used by this fungus to attack the coffee plant, to study the diversity of this species
  and for the development of molecular markers to distinguish races/isolates.
