abstract: The serine-threonine kinase TOR, the Target of Rapamycin, is an important
  regulator of nutrient, energy and stress signaling in eukaryotes. Sch9, a Ser/Thr
  kinase of AGC family (the cAMP-dependent PKA, cGMP- dependent protein kinase G and
  phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C family), is a substrate of TOR. Here, we
  characterized the fungal opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus Sch9 homologue
  (SchA). The schA null mutant was sensitive to rapamycin, high concentrations of
  calcium, hyperosmotic stress and SchA was involved in iron metabolism. The ΔschA
  null mutant showed increased phosphorylation of SakA, the A. fumigatus Hog1 homologue.
  The schA null mutant has increased and decreased trehalose and glycerol accumulation,
  respectively, suggesting SchA performs different roles for glycerol and trehalose
  accumulation during osmotic stress. The schA was transcriptionally regulated by
  osmotic stress and this response was dependent on SakA and MpkC. The double ΔschA
  ΔsakA and ΔschA ΔmpkC mutants were more sensitive to osmotic stress than the corresponding
  parental strains. Transcriptomics and proteomics identified direct and indirect
  targets of SchA post-exposure to hyperosmotic stress. Finally, ΔschA was avirulent
  in a low dose murine infection model. Our results suggest there is a complex network
  of interactions amongst the A. fumigatus TOR, SakA and SchA pathways.
