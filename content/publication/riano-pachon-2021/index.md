abstract: The collection of all transcripts in a cell, a tissue, or an organism is
  called the transcriptome, or meta-transcriptome when dealing with the transcripts
  of a community of different organisms. Nowadays, we have a vast array of technologies
  that allow us to assess the (meta-)transcriptome regarding its composition (which
  transcripts are produced) and the abundance of its components (what are the expression
  levels of each transcript), and we can do this across several samples, conditions,
  and time-points, at costs that are decreasing year after year, allowing experimental
  designs with ever-increasing complexity. Here we will present the current state
  of the art regarding the technologies that can be applied to the study of plant
  transcriptomes and their applications, including differential gene expression and
  coexpression analyses, identification of sequence polymorphisms, the application
  of machine learning for the identification of alternative splicing and ncRNAs, and
  the ranking of candidate genes for downstream studies. We continue with a collection
  of examples of these approaches in a diverse array of plant species to generate
  gene/transcript catalogs/atlases, population mapping, identification of genes related
  to stress phenotypes, and phylogenomics. We finalize the chapter with some of our
  ideas about the future of this dynamic field in plant physiology.
