abstract: Evolutionary retention of duplicated genes encoding transcription-associated
  proteins (TAPs, comprising transcription factors and other transcriptional regulators)
  has been hypothesized to be positively correlated with increasing morphological
  complexity and paleopolyploidizations, especially within the plant kingdom. Here,
  we present the most comprehensive set of classification rules for TAPs and its application
  for genome-wide analyses of plants and algae. Using a dated species tree and phylogenetic
  comparative (PC) analyses, we define the timeline of TAP loss, gain, and expansion
  among Viridiplantae and find that two major bursts of gain/expansion occurred, coinciding
  with the water-to-land transition and the radiation of flowering plants. For the
  first time, we provide PC proof for the long-standing hypothesis that TAPs are major
  driving forces behind the evolution of morphological complexity, the latter in Plantae
  being shaped significantly by polyploidization and subsequent biased paleolog retention.
  Principal component analysis incorporating the number of TAPs per genome provides
  an alternate and significant proxy for complexity, ideally suited for PC genomics.
  Our work lays the ground for further interrogation of the shaping of gene regulatory
  networks underlying the evolution of organism complexity.
