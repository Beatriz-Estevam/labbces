 abstract = {Multiple transitions from insect to wind pollination are associated with polyploidy and unisexual flowers in   (Ranunculaceae), yet the underlying genetics remains unknown. We generated a draft genome of  , a representative of a clade with ancestral floral traits (diploid, hermaphrodite, and insect pollinated) and a model for functional studies. Floral transcriptomes of   and of wind-pollinated, andromonoecious   are presented as a resource to facilitate candidate gene discovery in flowers with different sexual and pollination systems. A draft genome of   and two floral transcriptomes of   and   were obtained from HiSeq 2000 Illumina sequencing and de novo assembly. The   de novo draft genome assembly consisted of 44,860 contigs (N50 = 12,761 bp, 243 Mbp total length) and contained 84.5% conserved embryophyte single-copy genes. Floral transcriptomes contained representatives of most eukaryotic core genes, and most of their genes formed orthogroups. To validate the utility of these resources, potential candidate genes were identified for the different floral morphologies using stepwise data set comparisons. Single-copy gene analysis and simple sequence repeat markers were also generated as a resource for population-level and phylogenetic studies.},
