abstract: The GABI Primary Database, GabiPD (http://www.gabipd.org/), was established
  in the frame of the German initiative for Genome Analysis of the Plant Biological
  System (GABI). The goal of GabiPD is to collect, integrate, analyze and visualize
  primary information from GABI projects. GabiPD constitutes a repository and analysis
  platform for a wide array of heterogeneous data from high-throughput experiments
  in several plant species. Data from different 'omics' fronts are incorporated (i.e.
  genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics), originating from 14 different
  model or crop species. We have developed the concept of GreenCards for text-based
  retrieval of all data types in GabiPD (e.g. clones, genes, mutant lines). All data
  types point to a central Gene GreenCard, where gene information is integrated from
  genome projects or NCBI UniGene sets. The centralized Gene GreenCard allows visualizing
  ESTs aligned to annotated transcripts as well as displaying identified protein domains
  and gene structure. Moreover, GabiPD makes available interactive genetic maps from
  potato and barley, and protein 2DE gels from Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus.
  Gene expression and metabolic-profiling data can be visualized through MapManWeb.
  By the integration of complex data in a framework of existing knowledge, GabiPD
  provides new insights and allows for new interpretations of the data.
