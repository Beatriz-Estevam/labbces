abstract: Wickerhamomyces anomalus LBCM1105 is a yeast isolated from cachaça distillery
  fermentation vats, notable for exceptional glycerol consumption ability. We report
  its draft genome with 20.5x in-depth coverage and around 90% extension and completeness.
  It harbors the sequences of proteins involved in glycerol transport and metabolism.
