Life is organized through networks such as protein-protein interactions, gene-regulatory circuits, and metabolic pathways, in which the parts interact with each other. It is from these interactions that complex phenomena originate. Our understanding of biological networks is still minimal, especially for critical commercial crops such as sugarcane. Among these biological networks, gene co-expression networks have gained increasing attention, mainly due to studies that associate genes with clinical characteristics. At the same time, in plant biology, they showed potential to identify genes related to agronomic characteristics. We set up an experiment to identify genes involved in their response to the nitrogen supply in sugarcane. For this, the cultivar RB975375 (responsive to the supply of N) and RB937570 (non-responsive) was compared. Nitrogen was supplied at two levels (270 mg/kg of soil and 10 mg/kg of soil.
